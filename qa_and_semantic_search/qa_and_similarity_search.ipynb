      "page_content='MARCUS AURELIUS AT LANUVIUM  \\n \\n \\n_Letter from Celsus to Lucian_  \\n \\nI arrived at Lanuvium last night. The Court are here for the summer;  \\nthat is to say, the Emperor, the Empress, the Heir Apparent, and the  \\nEmperor’s nephew, Ummidius Quadratus, and the Senator who is on duty.  \\nAs soon as I arrived I was taken by Eclectus, the Chamberlain, to my  \\napartments, which are small, but from which one obtains a beautiful  \\nview of the Alban Hills. I was told that I would be expected to come to  \\nsupper, and that I must take care not to be late, as the Emperor was  \\npunctual to a minute, and the water clocks in the villa were purposely  \\nan hour fast according t o ordinary time.  \\n \\nA few minutes before the hour of supper a slave was sent to fetch me,  \\nand I was ushered into a large room, opening on to a portico from  \\nwhence you have a gorgeous view of the whole country, where the  \\nEmperor and his family meet before goi ng into the dining -room. \\n \\nI had never seen the Emperor before. He is short and looks delicate  \\nand a great deal older than he really is. His eyes have a weary  \\nexpression, and the general impression of the man would be one of great  \\nbenevolence and dignity we re it not marred by a certain stiffness and  \\nprimness in his demeanour. When he greets you with great affability,  \\nyou say to yourself, “What a charming man!” Then he stops short,  \\nand it is difficult, nay, impossible, to continue the conversation.  \\nAfter a pr olonged pause he asks you a question or makes some remark  \\non the weather or the topics of the day. But he does not pursue the  \\nsubject, and the result is a succession of awkward pauses and a general  \\natmosphere of discomfort.  \\n \\nWhether it be from the reserve which at once strikes you as being  \\nthe most salient feature of his character, or whether it be from the  \\nprimness and the sligh t touch of pedantry which are the result of the  \\npeculiar way in which he was brought up, there is a certain lack, not  \\nof dignity, indeed, but of impressiveness in the man. He strikes you  \\nmore as a dignified man than as a dignified monarch. Indeed, were I  \\nto meet Marcus Aurelius in the streets of Rome or Athens, dressed as  \\na simple mortal, I should be inclined to take him for a barber who  \\ncatered for the aristocracy. As it was, when I was first introduced  \\ninto that ante -room and saw the Emperor for the first  time, a wild  \\nlonging rose in me to say to him, “I will be shaved at half -past eight  \\nto-morrow morning.”  \\n \\nThe Empress Faustina is quite unlike what I had expected. There is no  \\ntrace of Imperial or any other kind of dignity about her. She is not  \\nvery tall; she has a delicate nose, slightly turned up, laughing eyes  \\nwhich will surely remain eternally young, and masses of thick, curly  \\nfair hair. I had imagined from the pictures and effigies of her that  \\nshe was dark; possibly she may have dyed it lately, but I d o not think  \\nso. She is restless in her movements; she is never still, but is always  \\non the move, and one has the impression that she is longing to, and  \\nwould if she dared, skip and jump about the room like a child. As it  \\nis, her arms, and especially her ha nds, are never for a moment still,  \\nand her eyes shift quickly from one person to another, smiling and  \\nlaughing. She made one feel that she was trying the whole time to be on  ' metadata={'source': 'sources\\\\MARCUS AURELIUS AT LANUVIUM.pdf', 'page': 0}\n"
